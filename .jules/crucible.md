## 2024-05-15 - Cross-Language Defect: Python os.path vulnerabilities across platform boundaries

**Learning:** `os.path` behaves unpredictably when constructing paths across different platforms, leading to runtime failures. It creates platform-specific paths as strings, making it vulnerable to injection or hardcoded assumptions across different operating systems.

**Action:** Consistently use `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.path` everywhere. The `pathlib.Path` construct inherently validates and normalizes paths contextually to the running OS, abstracting away string formatting vulnerabilities.

**Defect Pattern ID:** PATTERN-005

**Related Entries:** []

**Axes Affected:** IV (Operational)

**Level:** L4
